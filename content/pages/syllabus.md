## Texts

Simmons, George F. *Calculus with Analytic Geometry.* 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1995. ISBN: 0070576424.

Students will also receive "{{% resource_link 2b08aca9-6668-01a1-680a-9dea58eabaee "18.02 Supplementary Notes and Problems" %}}" by Prof. Arthur Mattuck.

## Homework

There are twelve problem sets.

Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged, but

- Attempt each part of each problem yourself. Read each portion of the problem before asking for help. If you don't understand what is being asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and then make an honest attempt to solve it.
- Write up each problem independently. On both Part A and B exercises you are expected to write the answer in your own words.
- Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If you fail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to serious penalties.
- It is illegal to consult materials from previous semesters.

## Exams

There are four in-class 50-minute exams, and one final exam.

If a student misses or fails an exam, he or she may take a make-up exam at certain arranged times. Make-ups for failed exams can boost the student's grade only up to the lowest passing score.

## Grading

Grading is based an a 900 point scale, where the homework is worth 250 points, the four exams are worth a total of 400 points, and the Final Exam is worth 250 points.
