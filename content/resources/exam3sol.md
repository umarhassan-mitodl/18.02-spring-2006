description: This file provides solutions to problems on double and iterated integrals,
  double integrals in polar coordinates, applications, change of variables, triple
  integrals in rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, spherical coordinates, gravitational
  attraction, line integrals in the plane, gradient fields and path independence,
  conservative fields and potential functions, Green's theorem, 2-dimensional curl
  (vorticity), and simply-connected regions.
